### **2. Gameplay Mechanics**

#### **2.1 The Core Loop**
The player's journey follows a satisfying and repeatable loop:
1.  **Explore:** Traverse the overworld map, entering towns, dungeons, and points of interest.
2.  **Interact & Battle:** Talk to NPCs to get quests or encounter enemies, triggering a "Pong Battle."
3.  **Vanquish:** Defeat the enemy in the Pong Battle by reducing their HP to zero.
4.  **Reward:** Earn Experience Points (XP), Gold, and potentially loot (new equipment).
5.  **Strengthen:** Use XP to level up and improve stats, use Gold to buy better gear, and equip new loot to become more powerful.
6.  **Progress:** Use your newfound strength to take on tougher challenges and advance the main story.

#### **2.2 The "Pong Battle" System**
Pong is the combat. Instead of scoring points, the goal is to deal damage.

*   **HP System:** Both player and enemy have a Health Point (HP) bar. Getting the Energy Orb past an opponent's Aegis (paddle) deals a base amount of damage (e.g., 10 damage).
*   **The Aegis:** This is the player's paddle. Its properties (size, speed, special effects) are determined by equipped gear.
*   **The Energy Orb:** This is the ball. Its speed, size, and elemental properties are influenced by stats and equipped gear.
*   **Spirit Meter:** A resource bar (mana) below the HP bar. It regenerates slowly over time and is used to activate powerful special abilities.
*   **Battle Arenas:** Each battle takes place on a unique field that can influence gameplay. Arenas may contain static obstacles (pillars, bumpers), dynamic hazards (lava pools, shifting walls), or power-up spawn points.

#### **2.3 RPG Systems**
Player growth is dictated by four core stats:

*   **POWER (PWR):** Determines the force of your returns. Higher PWR adds more speed to the Orb when you hit it, making it harder for the opponent to react. It also slightly increases damage dealt.
    *   *Formula Example:* `Damage = BaseDamage + (PWR * 0.5)`
*   **AGILITY (AGI):** Dictates the movement speed of your Aegis. High AGI allows for quicker positioning and defense against sharp angles.
*   **GRIT (GRT):** Your defensive stat. It reduces incoming damage by a flat amount and slightly increases the "sweet spot" on your Aegis, making powerful returns easier.
    *   *Formula Example:* `DamageTaken = IncomingDamage - (GRT * 0.2)`
*   **FOCUS (FCS):** Governs your Spirit pool. It increases your maximum Spirit and the regeneration rate, allowing for more frequent use of special abilities.

#### **2.4 Equipment & Loot**
There are three equipment slots, with gear following a rarity system (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic).

*   **The Aegis (Paddle):** The primary piece of equipment.
    *   *Example 1 (Common):* Worn Wooden Aegis - `+2 GRT`
    *   *Example 2 (Rare):* Swiftsteel Aegis - `+10 AGI, -3 PWR`. Fast but light-hitting.
    *   *Example 3 (Epic):* Golem's Bulwark - `+15 GRT, +5 PWR, -8 AGI`. Slow but incredibly powerful and defensive. Aegis size is 15% larger.
*   **The Core (Ball Appearance/Property):** Modifies the Energy Orb.
    *   *Example 1:* Frost Core - Orb has a chance to slow the enemy's Aegis on hit.
    *   *Example 2:* Magma Core - Orb applies a light damage-over-time effect to the enemy's HP.
    *   *Example 3:* Phantom Core - Orb becomes momentarily transparent after bouncing off a wall.
*   **The Charm (Accessory):** Provides passive bonuses.
    *   *Example 1:* Pendant of Vigor - `+20 Max HP`.
    *   *Example 2:* Ring of Spirit - `+1 Spirit Regeneration per second`.

#### **2.5 Abilities (Spirit Skills)**
These are game-changing moves activated by spending Spirit. Players unlock and upgrade them via a skill tree.

*   **Aegis Slam:** (Cost: 25 Spirit) Your next return sends the Orb at high speed. If the enemy returns it, their Aegis is briefly stunned (0.5s).
*   **Barrier:** (Cost: 40 Spirit) Conjure a temporary, stationary barrier behind your Aegis that will block the Orb once before shattering.
*   **Multi-Orb:** (Cost: 60 Spirit) Splits the Energy Orb into three. Two are illusions that shatter on contact, while one is real.
*   **Phase Return:** (Cost: 35 Spirit) Your next return allows the Orb to pass through one environmental obstacle harmlessly.

#### **2.6 The Overworld**
*   A top-down or isometric view map, stylized like a classic 16-bit RPG.
*   The player navigates between locations like towns, forests, dungeons, and mountain passes.
*   Random encounters can occur in hostile areas, triggering a Pong Battle.

### **3. Narrative & World**

#### **3.1 Story Synopsis**
The world of Arcania, once held in perfect balance, is being consumed by "The Static"â€”a mysterious force that corrupts the land and its creatures, turning them aggressive and erratic. You are a novice "Aegis Wielder," one of the few who can channel energy into the ancient art of Pong combat. Guided by an old master, you must travel to the heart of the Static, defeating corrupted champions to collect fragments of a legendary artifact, the only thing that can restore harmony.

#### **3.2 The World of Arcania**
A high-fantasy world with distinct regions:
*   **The Verdant Valley:** The peaceful starting area with lush forests and quaint villages.
*   **The Stonetooth Mountains:** A treacherous region with Golems, Goblins, and arenas featuring falling rocks.
*   **The Shimmering Marshes:** A mystical swamp where battles involve slowing water pits and enemies that can turn invisible.
*   **The Corrupted Core:** The endgame region, consumed by the Static, with glitchy, unpredictable arenas and powerful foes.

#### **3.3 Key Characters**
*   **The Protagonist:** A silent hero, allowing the player to project themselves onto the character.
*   **Master Elmsworth:** The wise and elderly mentor who teaches the player the basics of Pong combat and sets them on their quest.
*   **Rival Knight Valerius:** A skilled and arrogant Aegis Wielder who believes only he is strong enough to stop the Static. He serves as a recurring boss and measuring stick for the player's progress.

#### **3.4 Enemy Factions & Designs**
Enemies are not just reskins; they have unique Aegis behaviors and abilities.
*   **Forest Sprites:** Have very small, fast-moving Aegises. They excel at sharp angles.
*   **Rock Golems:** Wield massive, slow-moving stone Aegises. They hit incredibly hard and can sometimes summon temporary rock obstacles on the field.
*   **Void Specters:** Their Aegises can teleport to different points on their side of the field, making them highly unpredictable.
*   **Bosses:** Major story antagonists with multiple phases, unique arenas, and powerful, telegraphed special attacks that the player must learn to counter.

### **4. Art & Visual Style**

#### **4.1 Overall Aesthetic**
A "Modern Retro" blend: High-fidelity 16-bit pixel art for characters and environments, enhanced by modern lighting and visual effects.

#### **4.2 URP Implementation**
*   **2D Lighting:** Used extensively to create atmosphere. Torches will cast flickering light in dungeons, and magical Orbs will act as moving light sources, illuminating the battle arena.
*   **Post-Processing:**
    *   **Bloom:** Essential for giving magical effects, the Orb, and UI elements a vibrant, energetic glow.
    *   **Chromatic Aberration & Film Grain:** Used subtly in the "Corrupted" areas to create a sense of unease and distortion.
    *   **Vignette:** To focus the player's attention during intense moments or story cutscenes.
*   **Shader Graph:**
    *   To create shimmering energy effects on the Aegises.
    *   To develop dynamic Orb trails that change color and intensity based on speed.
    *   To implement environmental effects like heat distortion in volcanic arenas or rippling water surfaces.

#### **4.3 Environment Design**
Overworld maps are richly detailed pixel art. Battle arenas are visually tied to their location (e.g., a forest arena has trees as side-walls and leaves that drift across the screen).

#### **4.4 Character & Enemy Design**
Characters have expressive, animated portraits for dialogue and detailed sprites for the overworld. In battle, enemies are represented by their unique Aegis and sometimes a background sprite reacting to the duel.

---

### **5. Audio Design**

#### **5.1 Music**
An adaptive soundtrack. The overworld music is melodic and atmospheric, reflecting the region. During battle, the music becomes more intense and rhythmic, with crescendos on long rallies. Boss battles have unique, epic musical themes. Think chiptune melodies blended with orchestral elements.

#### **5.2 Sound Effects**
*   **Impacts:** Crucial for game feel. A variety of satisfying `thwack`, `ping`, and `zap` sounds for the Orb hitting different Aegises and walls.
*   **Abilities:** Each Spirit Skill has a distinct audio cue for activation and impact.
*   **UI:** Clean, non-intrusive sounds for navigating menus.

---

### **6. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)**

#### **6.1 Battle UI**
*   Clean and readable. HP and Spirit bars are prominently displayed at the top or bottom of the screen for both player and enemy.
*   Spirit Skill icons are shown in a corner with clear indicators for when they are on cooldown.
*   Damage numbers pop up when a score is made.

#### **6.2 Overworld & Menu UI**
*   Inspired by classic SNES RPGs.
*   **Character Menu:** Shows stats, equipped gear, and current level progress.
*   **Inventory:** A grid-based system for managing loot.
*   **Map:** A world map that fills in as the player explores, showing key locations and quest markers.

#### **6.3 Controls**
*   Simple and intuitive.
*   **Overworld:** D-Pad/Analog Stick for movement, one button for interaction.
*   **Battle:** D-Pad/Analog Stick for Aegis movement, four face buttons mapped to Spirit Skills.

---

### **7. Progression & Game Flow**

#### **7.1 Player Progression**
*   **Leveling Up:** Defeating enemies grants XP. Each level-up grants stat points to be manually allocated by the player, and one Skill Point.
*   **Gear-Based Progression:** A significant portion of the player's power comes from finding or buying better equipment. This encourages exploration and taking on optional side quests for powerful rewards.

#### **7.2 Mission Structure**
A main story questline guides the player through the world. Towns and NPCs offer optional side quests, which typically involve defeating a specific powerful enemy, clearing a mini-dungeon, or finding a lost item, rewarding the player with Gold, XP, and unique gear.

#### **7.3 Skill Tree**
Players spend Skill Points to unlock and upgrade abilities. The tree is divided into three branches:
*   **Vanguard (Offensive):** Focuses on enhancing Orb speed, damage, and offensive skills like *Aegis Slam*.
*   **Guardian (Defensive):** Improves defensive stats, HP, and skills like *Barrier*.
*   **Tactician (Utility):** Enhances Spirit regeneration, movement speed, and unlocks versatile skills like *Phase Return*.
