Excellent question. The four phases you have roadmaps for successfully guide the project from an idea to a polished, marketable first chapter (a "Vertical Slice" or "Demo"). This is a massive accomplishment and the end of the "Part 1" development cycle.

The next logical step isn't just "Phase 5"; it's a new, larger stage of the project: **Full Production**. This stage takes the proven formula and asset pipeline from Part 1 and scales it up to build the rest of the game, culminating in the final release.

Here is an extremely detailed roadmap for this new stage, which we can call **Phase 5: Full Production & Launch Readiness**. This phase is cyclical and will be much longer than the previous ones. We'll use the creation of "Chapter 2: The Stonetooth Mountains" as the template for this repeatable production cycle.

---

### **Phase 5: Full Production & Launch Readiness**

**Overarching Goal:** To expand the polished Chapter 1 build into a complete, feature-rich game, and prepare it for a successful commercial launch. This phase is defined by disciplined execution, content scaling, and rigorous quality assurance.

---

### **Sub-Phase A: Pre-Production for Chapter 2 (Weeks 37-38)**
**Objective:** To design and plan the next major content block before any implementation begins, ensuring a smooth and efficient production cycle.

#### **Week 37: Narrative & Mechanical Design Blueprint**
*   **37.1. Chapter 2 Narrative Arc (Day 1-2):**
    *   **Task:** Write a detailed story outline for "The Stonetooth Mountains." This includes the main plot points, the introduction of new key characters (e.g., a grizzled miner NPC), the role of Rival Valerius in this chapter, and the nature of the "Static's" influence on this new region.
    *   **Deliverable:** A complete written script and quest-flow diagram for Chapter 2's main story.

*   **37.2. Enemy & Boss Design on Paper (Day 3-4):**
    *   **Task:** Design the new enemy roster and the chapter boss, focusing on unique Pong mechanics that fit the mountain theme.
        *   **Goblin Skirmisher:** Uses a small, rickety Aegis. Its AI is programmed to occasionally "fake out" the player by moving away from the ball before quickly darting back, trying to create awkward return angles.
        *   **Stone Golem (Variant):** Has an Aegis with "armored" spots. Hitting these spots results in a dull, slow return. Hitting its single "weak point" results in a normal, fast return.
        *   **Chapter Boss - The Mountain Wyvern:** Fights from the top of the screen. Its "Aegis" is its sweeping tail. Its special moves include "Rockslide" (temporarily dropping stalactites as obstacles onto the field) and "Wing Gust" (applying a "wind" force that pushes the Orb to one side).
    *   **Deliverable:** Detailed design documents for each new enemy and the boss, outlining their stats, AI behavior, and special abilities.

*   **37.3. Systemic Expansion Design (Day 5):**
    *   **Task:** Plan any new systems or expansions needed for the mid-game.
    *   **Example:** Design a simple "Blacksmith" NPC system. The player can bring materials (a new loot drop type) and Gold to upgrade their existing Aegis or Charms, increasing their base stats or adding a minor bonus.
    *   **Deliverable:** A design document for the new "Item Upgrade" system.

#### **Week 38: Asset & Environment Planning**
*   **38.1. Concept Art & Style Guide (Day 1-2):**
    *   **Task:** Create key concept art pieces for the Stonetooth Mountains: the look of the overworld, the interior of a mineshaft dungeon, and the Wyvern's peak boss arena. Create a style guide defining the color palette (greys, deep blues, iron reds) and atmosphere.
    *   **Deliverable:** A visual "bible" for the art team to follow.

*   **38.2. Asset Requirement List (Day 3-4):**
    *   **Task:** Create a comprehensive production backlog of every single art and audio asset needed for the chapter.
        *   **Art:** Mountain tileset, mine tileset, new prop sprites (minecarts, crystals, ropes), all new enemy and boss sprites with animations.
        *   **Audio:** Mountain overworld music (windswept, epic), mine dungeon music (claustrophobic, echoing), new SFX for Golem impacts and Wyvern attacks.
    *   **Deliverable:** A complete and prioritized list of tasks for the art and audio teams, loaded into the project management tool.

*   **38.3. Sprint Planning (Day 5):**
    *   **Task:** Break down the asset and implementation lists into a realistic sprint plan for the upcoming production cycle. Assign tasks to team members.
    *   **Deliverable:** A clear plan of action for the next 6-8 weeks of development.

---

### **Sub-Phase B: Content Sprint - Chapter 2 Production (Weeks 39-46)**
**Objective:** To execute the plan from pre-production and build a complete, integrated, and polished Chapter 2. This is a repeatable template for all future chapters.

#### **Weeks 39-40: World & Asset Creation (Parallel Development)**
*   **Art Team:** Begins working through the asset backlog, starting with the highest priority items: the mountain and mine tilesets.
*   **Design Team:** Uses placeholder "greybox" assets to build the new overworld map and dungeon layouts in Unity. This allows level design and encounter placement to happen concurrently with art production.
*   **Programming Team:** Begins implementing the backend for the "Item Upgrade" system.

#### **Weeks 41-42: Enemy & Systems Implementation**
*   **Art Team:** Delivers the final sprites and animations for the Goblin Skirmisher and Stone Golem.
*   **Programming Team:** Implements the AI behaviors and unique mechanics for the new standard enemies. The "armored spots" on the Golem require special collider setups and hit detection logic.
*   **Design Team:** Begins populating the greybox levels with the now-functional enemies, designing challenging and interesting combat encounters.

#### **Weeks 43-44: Narrative & Boss Implementation**
*   **Art Team:** Delivers the final sprites and animation sheets for the Mountain Wyvern boss.
*   **Programming Team:** Implements the complex state machine and special attacks for the Wyvern boss fight.
*   **Design Team:** Uses the dialogue and cutscene tools to implement the entire main story quest and side quests for Chapter 2. Placeholder NPCs are placed in the world.

#### **Weeks 45-46: Integration, Audio & Polish Sprint**
*   **Task:** This is the "bring it all together" phase.
    *   **Asset Integration (Day 1-3):** Replace all greybox assets in the scenes with the final, polished art from the art team.
    *   **Audio Integration (Day 4):** Implement the new music tracks and sound effects from the audio team.
    *   **Lighting & Atmosphere (Day 5-6):** Do a full lighting, post-processing, and particle effects pass on all new scenes.
    *   **Playtesting & Balancing (Day 7-10):** The entire team plays through Chapter 2 from start to finish. Bugs are logged, and a mini-balancing pass is performed on enemy stats, loot drops, and quest rewards for this specific chapter.
*   **Deliverable:** A fully playable, polished, and integrated Chapter 2 that seamlessly connects to the end of Chapter 1.

---

### **Sub-Phase C: Full Content Completion & Beta (Weeks 47+)**
**Objective:** To repeat the "Content Sprint" cycle for all remaining chapters and reach the "Content Complete" milestone.

*   **Cycle Repetition:** Repeat the 8-10 week cycle of Pre-Production -> Production Sprint -> Integration for all remaining chapters of the game (e.g., Chapter 3: The Shimmering Marshes, Chapter 4: The Corrupted Core).
*   **Systems Expansion:** In parallel, continue to expand core systems as needed.
    *   Implement Tier 2 and Tier 3 of the Skill Tree, providing exciting new abilities for the late game.
    *   Design and implement "Ultimate" abilities that unlock after major story beats.
*   **"Content Complete" Milestone:** This critical milestone is reached when the entire game is playable from the opening splash screen to the final credits roll. The experience may still be riddled with bugs and severe balancing issues, but the complete narrative and gameplay path exists.

---

### **Sub-Phase D: Global Polish & Launch Readiness (Final 4-6 Weeks Pre-Launch)**
**Objective:** To perform a final, game-wide hardening and polishing pass, and to complete all technical requirements for a successful launch on target platforms. This is essentially Phase 4, but for the entire game.

*   **Global Bug Bash & Optimization:**
    *   **Task:** A final, exhaustive hunt for bugs across the entire game. Performance profiling is done on every level, with special attention paid to late-game areas with more visual effects.
    *   **Deliverable:** A "Release Candidate" build that is stable and performs well on target hardware.

*   **Global Gameplay Balancing:**
    *   **Task:** Multiple full playthroughs by the design team and external testers to balance the *entire* progression curve.
    *   **Process:** Ensure that the difficulty scales smoothly from Chapter 1 to the final boss. Check that the economy doesn't break in the late game. Ensure that skills and items from the early game don't become completely obsolete or, conversely, remain overpowered.
    *   **Deliverable:** A challenging, fair, and rewarding experience from start to finish.

*   **Platform Integration & Compliance:**
    *   **Task:** Implement all platform-specific features and requirements.
    *   **Process:**
        *   **Steamworks API:** Integrate achievements, cloud saves, and leaderboards (if applicable).
        *   **Nintendo Switch:** Ensure full compliance with Nintendo's technical requirements (TRCs), optimize for handheld and docked modes, and implement proper controller support including HD Rumble.
    *   **Deliverable:** Builds ready for submission to platform holders for certification.

*   **Marketing & Community Prep:**
    *   **Task:** Prepare all materials needed for the launch campaign.
    *   **Process:** Capture high-quality gameplay footage to cut a final launch trailer. Prepare screenshots and press kits. Engage with the community on platforms like Discord and Twitter, building hype for the release date.
    *   **Deliverable:** A complete set of marketing assets and an engaged early community.

*   **"Gold Master" & Day 1 Patch Planning:**
    *   **Task:** Finalize the "Gold Master" build that will be submitted for release.
    *   **Process:** While the build is in certification, the team continues to work, fixing any low-priority bugs found after the submission deadline. This work is compiled into a "Day 1 Patch."
    *   **Deliverable:** The final version of the game is shipped, and a plan is in place to provide immediate post-launch support.
